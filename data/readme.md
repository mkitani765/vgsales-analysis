# File Description

## vgsales.csv
vgsales.csv is the original CSV file provided from the Kaggle dataset. It hasn't been modified, just extracted from the original zip file.

## vgsales.ods
vgsales.ods is the file I cleaned and enriched. While it isn't perfect, the changelog provided should have enough information to show what I did and why I did it.

## vgsales_cleaned.csv
This is basically the same as vgsales.ods but in a .csv format for easy importing into a database.

## cleaning_changelog.txt
Any modifications or changes from the original .csv to my cleaned .csv and the .ods file are listed in this document.
