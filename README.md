# vgsales-analysis

## Project Overview
I downloaded a dataset about video game sales from Kaggle to explore what insights I could glean. In this project, I explored regional preferences for games, game-by-platform sales, and trending of preferences through the platform choices on a per-game basis.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales

## Project Highlights
- **Dataset**: Initially I had to use Calc to clean the dataset; there were a lot of null values in the publisher and release year fields, as well as a handful of duplicate entries or games that were split into multiple rows for no discernable reason. I merged the duplicate entries and filled in all the null values using information I found on Wikipedia or GameFAQs.

- **Skill Demonstration**:
	- Data wrangling, primarily cleaning and enriching.
	- SQL querying
	- Insights into different gaming trends
	
## Interesting Findings
- **Best Sellers**: The best selling games of all time according to the dataset are 50% Nintendo first party games.
- **PokePopularity**: Pokemon dominates the best selling games list in the Japanese market, and despite Pokemon's popularity in North America, Mario is the dominant brand name there. Additionally, Pokemon hasn't outsold Duck Hunt in the US since the first Pokemon game.
- **Top Publishers**: Surprisingly despite the dominance of Nintendo's games in terms of sales, Microsoft as a publisher has significantly higher overall global sales when compared to Nintendo. In fact, Microsoft has sold more than double the units of Nintendo games.
